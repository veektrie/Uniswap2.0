I am excited about this new Web3 project I am working on with CRANQ.
CRANQ makes Web3 Development Easy with Flexible Low-Code
CRANQ is a graphical and intuitive IDE designed for the discovery, and re-use of existing code and smart contracts.
CRANQ nodes are like LEGOS,
you can put them together in a graphical, composable way, so you can build functionality fast.  
I was able also to create ERC20 tokens which would also be used in the uni swap project, I have always been fascinated by how blockchain and nodes work and I am one step closer every day to understanding this amazing technology.
